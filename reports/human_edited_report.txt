**[Human-Reviewed] GDPR Compliance Report**

---

### **1. Non-Compliant or Incomplete Requirements**

#### **A. Data Breach Notification (Critical Omission)**
- **Issue**: The SRS fails to outline any mechanism for data breach notification to supervisory authorities within **72 hours**, as mandated by GDPR (Articles 33-34).
- **Gap**: Absence of procedures or triggers for internal breach escalation or user communication.

#### **B. Right to Erasure**
- **Issue**: Users lack a documented path to request deletion of their personal data.
- **Clause Concern**:
  - *User Management (2.1.6)* only mentions account deletion by admins, not user-initiated erasure in compliance with Article 17.

#### **C. Data Minimization**
- **Issue**:
  - The legal basis for collecting data under *User Registration (2.1.1)* is unspecified.
  - *Product Reviews (2.2.5)* may unintentionally expose personal data, and there's no remedy process.
- **Notes**:
  - Sensitive fields such as phone numbers should be re-evaluated for necessity.

#### **D. Consent Management**
- **Issue**:
  - Current approach to consent lacks GDPR rigor.
  - Consent is implied or vague, especially for *Guest Checkout (2.3.2)*.
- **Improvement Area**: Each data collection instance must be preceded by **explicit opt-in consent**, and evidence of consent must be stored.

#### **E. Third-Party Processors**
- **Issue**:
  - Use of payment and hosting providers is acknowledged (*2.3.3*, *4.2*), but GDPR accountability is not delegated or verified.
- **Missing Elements**:
  - No requirement for **data processing agreements (DPAs)** with vendors.

#### **F. Data Retention**
- **Issue**: The SRS does not specify retention timelines or mechanisms for data disposal after service termination or data expiry.
- **Impact**: May lead to violations of GDPR’s **storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e))**.

### **2. Recommended Actions (Updated)**

#### **A. Data Breach Notification**
- Include an automated alert system and a documented procedure in *Section 5.3*:
  > "If a data breach occurs, notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours and inform affected users promptly, in accordance with GDPR Articles 33 and 34."

#### **B. Right to Erasure**
- Expand *User Management (2.1)* to allow:
  > "User-submitted requests for data erasure via dashboard or support. Ensure audit trail of deletion requests and responses."

#### **C. Data Minimization**
- Add to *User Registration (2.1.1)*:
  > "Data collected must be the minimum necessary for core functionality. Justify all fields with a lawful basis (e.g., contract)."
- Add to *Product Reviews (2.2.5)*:
  > "Provide editing/deletion options for submitted reviews. Redact personal identifiers upon request."

#### **D. Consent Management**
- Revise *Privacy Policy (5.1)*:
  > "Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous—e.g., via unticked checkboxes."
- Amend *Guest Checkout (2.3.2)*:
  > "Explicitly request and record user consent for processing shipping information."

#### **E. Third-Party Compliance**
- Add DPA-related language to *Sections 2.3.3 and 4.2*:
  > "Only use third parties with GDPR-compliant practices. Secure data processing agreements and perform annual compliance audits."

#### **F. Retention Policy**
- New clause under *Terms of Service (5.2)*:
  > "Define retention periods by data category. Automatically delete or anonymize data upon expiry."

### **3. Positive Aspects (Verified)**

- **Encryption**: Use of HTTPS and at-rest encryption meets Article 32 requirements.
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances account security.
- **Privacy Documentation**: Inclusion of a privacy policy is a strong foundation, though it needs further enhancement.

### **4. Identified Weaknesses**

- Lack of breach notification process.
- No support for data erasure rights.
- Vague or missing consent procedures.
- No assurance of third-party GDPR alignment.
- Undefined retention lifecycle for personal data.

### **5. Legal Validation Summary**

The above recommendations align with key GDPR mandates including:
- **Articles 5, 6, 7** (Principles and Consent)
- **Articles 17, 32-34** (Erasure, Security, and Breach Notification)
- **Articles 28-30** (Processor Responsibility and Documentation)

This updated version offers a clearer, enforceable path to GDPR compliance for the described software system.
